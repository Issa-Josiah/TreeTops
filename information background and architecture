Tree Planting & Tracking App
    Purpose: Track tree-planting efforts in a community or organization.
    Tech Stack:
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (cards and progress sections)
    Backend: Python (Django)
    Database: SQLite
    Version Control: GitHub
    Core Features:
    User login/register
    Form to log each planted tree (species, location, date)
    List view of planted trees per user
    Statistics: total trees, CO₂ absorbed estimate
    Community leaderboard
    UI/UX Concepts Applied:
    Card layouts for individual tree entries
    Simple icons and illustrations of nature
    Use of green gradients and earthy tones

The Tree Planting and Tracking App is a web-based system designed to promote environmental sustainability by encouraging individuals and organizations to record, track, and monitor tree-planting activities.
The main purpose of the project is to support climate action (SDG 13) by creating a digital platform where users can log details of trees they have planted, such as the species name, location, and date of planting. 
The system will allow users to create personal accounts, view the total number of trees they have planted, and see an estimated amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by those trees over time. 
It will also include a community leaderboard that highlights top contributors, encouraging friendly competition and motivating more people to participate in reforestation efforts. Additionally, 
the app will feature an educational section that provides information on different tree species, their environmental benefits, and the importance of reforestation in combating climate change.
Administrators will be able to manage user accounts, verify tree entries, and update educational content through the Django admin panel. 
The project will be developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the user interface, ensuring a clean and responsive design, while Python and Django will be used to handle the backend logic, data storage, and authentication.
All source code will be managed and version-controlled using GitHub. Overall, the system aims to create environmental awareness, promote community involvement in tree planting, and make climate action measurable and engaging through
technology.


 Project Title: Tree Planting and Tracking App

 1. Project Overview
The Tree Planting and Tracking App is a web-based platform that encourages individuals, schools, and organizations to contribute to reforestation and environmental restoration by:
Logging every tree they plant,
Tracking their environmental impact over time, and
Connecting with a community of eco-conscious users.
It combines education, accountability, and community participation to make tree planting measurable and motivating.

2. Project Goal
The goal is to promote and track sustainable actions that help fight climate change.
Specifically, the app aims to:
Encourage people to plant trees and record them.
Allow users to track how many trees they’ve planted.
Create a community leaderboard for motivation and recognition.
Educate users on tree species and their benefits.
Employs tree growers

 3. Target Users
Individuals – Anyone who plants trees in their backyard, community, or school.
Environmental Clubs or NGOs – Groups that organize tree-planting drives.
Schools/Students – To engage in sustainability projects and competitions.
Companies/CSR Teams – For logging and reporting reforestation efforts.

 4. Core Features
Feature	Description
User Registration & Login	Users create an account to save and manage their planting data.
Add Tree Record	Users fill out a form with details like species name, date planted, and optional photo.
View My Trees	A personalized dashboard showing all trees planted by the user.
Community Leaderboard	Shows top contributors (users or groups) by number of trees planted.
Statistics Dashboard	Displays total trees planted, and global progress.
Tree Details Page	Each tree entry includes species info, date, location, and growth updates.
Educational Section	Facts about tree species, benefits of reforestation, and climate impact.
Admin Panel (Django Admin)	Admin can manage users, verify tree entries, and update content.

 5. System Functionality (How It Works)
- Step 1 – Registration & Login
Users sign up using their email and password. Django’s built-in authentication handles this securely.
- Step 2 – Add a Tree
Users click “Add Tree” → Fill in a form with:
Tree species
Planting date
photo upload
The app then saves the data to the database.
- Step 3 – View Progress
The dashboard displays:
Total number of trees planted
Growth milestones (optional future feature)
- Step 4 – Community Section
Users can see:
Leaderboard (Top Planters)
Global tree count
Impact visualizations (charts with Bootstrap)
- Step 5 – Education & Awareness
A section provides simple educational content:
Benefits of tree planting
How trees combat climate change
Local and global tree campaigns

 6. Key Functional Pages
Home Page: Overview of project goals and community stats.
Login / Register Pages: Secure authentication forms.
Dashboard: Personalized tree data, statistics, and impact visualization.
Add Tree Page: Data entry form.
Leaderboard: List of users ranked by total trees planted.

7. UI/UX Design Concept
Design Principles Used:
Simplicity: Clean layout with plenty of white space.
Consistency: Reusable Bootstrap components (cards, navbars, buttons).
Color Scheme:
Green: Nature, growth, sustainability.
Brown/Beige: Earth tones.
White: Clean background for readability.
Typography: Friendly, rounded fonts for accessibility.
Responsive Design: Bootstrap grid system ensures usability on all devices.
Example Layouts:
Dashboard:

 Data Flow Summary
The user accesses the web interface (frontend).
Requests (HTTP GET/POST) are sent to Django views via URLs.
Django processes the request (logic, validation, calculations).
Data is retrieved or updated in the SQLite database.
The backend sends processed data to the frontend to display dashboards, reports, or leaderboards.

 2. Database Design (ERD – Entity Relationship Diagram)
 Main Entities
User – represents individuals who register and log in.
Tree – represents trees planted by users.
Species – stores data about tree species (optional but useful for CO₂ estimates).

 ERD Structure (Text-Based Representation)
+--------------------+
|      User          |
+--------------------+
| user_id (PK)       |
| username           |
| email              |
| password           |
| date_joined        |
+--------------------+
          |
          | 1---∞
          |
+--------------------+
|       Tree         |
+--------------------+
| tree_id (PK)       |
| user_id (FK)       → User.user_id
| species_id (FK)    → Species.species_id
| species_name       |
| location           |
| date_planted       |
| photo              |
| co2_absorption     |
+--------------------+

 Relationships Explained
User → Tree = One-to-Many
Each user can plant multiple trees, but each tree is associated with one user.
Species → Tree = One-to-Many
Each tree belongs to one species, but a species can be linked to many tree entries.

 Django Model Representation
Here’s how the above ERD maps to Django models:
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Species(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    avg_co2_absorption = models.FloatField(help_text="Average CO2 absorbed per year (kg)")
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class Tree(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    species = models.ForeignKey(Species, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    species_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    date_planted = models.DateField()
    photo = models.ImageField(upload_to='tree_photos/', blank=True, null=True)
    co2_absorption = models.FloatField(default=0.0)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.species_name} - {self.user.username}"

 3. How the Architecture and Database Work Together
When a user logs in, Django authenticates them through the User model.
When they add a new tree, data is stored in the Tree table linked to that user.
If species data exists, the app retrieves the average CO₂ value from the Species table.
The backend computes total CO₂ absorbed by summing the user’s trees.
The frontend dashboard (HTML + Bootstrap) displays this information visually (charts, cards, and leaderboards).
